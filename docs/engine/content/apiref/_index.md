If youâ€™re interested in writing code to control a WWT display, you might want to
check out the following sections of the documentation:

- For pure JavaScript without any frameworks (the [hosted JavaScript
  model](@/getting-started/hosted-javascript-model.md)) see
  [@wwtelescope/engine](./engine/).
- To control an embedded instance of the research app (the [embedded app
  model](@/getting-started/embedded-app-model.md)) see
  [@wwtelescope/research-app-messages](./research-app-messages/).
- For a custom component-based web app built with Vue (the [Vue component
  model](@/getting-started/vue-component-model.md)) see [the WWT Pinia
  interface](engine-pinia/functions/engineStore.html#md:the-wwt-pinia-interface)
  in [@wwtelescope/engine-pinia](./engine-pinia/).
