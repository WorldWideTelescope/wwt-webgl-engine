# @wwtelescope/ui-components

The [@wwtelescope/ui-components] package builds on the [Pinia] store provided by the
[@wwtelescope/engine-pinia] package to create a set of reusable Vue components that
facilitate building user interfaces for WorldWide Telescope (WWT) applications.
Some of these components are inspired by UI elements of the [WWT webclient][webclient].
The WWT Research App [@wwtelescope/research-app] uses the Finder Scope component
provided by this package. Learn more about WWT [here][wwt-home].
